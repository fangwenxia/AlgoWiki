== Problem Description==
an optimal binary search tree (Optimal BST); sometimes called a weight-balanced
 binary tree; is a binary search tree which provides the smallest possible search
 time (or expected search time) for a given sequence of accesses
 (or access probabilities). Optimal BSTs are generally divided
 into two types: static and dynamic.
